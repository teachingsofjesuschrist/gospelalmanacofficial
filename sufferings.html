    <h1 style="color: blue;">The Sufferings of Jesus Christ</h1>

  <h2>Agony in the Garden</h2>
  <p>
    On the night before His crucifixion, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. Knowing the suffering that awaited Him, He was deeply distressed and sorrowful (Matthew 26:36-38). He prayed, “Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will” (Matthew 26:39).
  </p>
  <p>
    His agony was so intense that His sweat became like drops of blood (Luke 22:44). His disciples, meanwhile, could not stay awake to pray with Him (Matthew 26:40-41).
  </p>

  <h2>Betrayal and Arrest</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, one of His own disciples. Judas identified Jesus to the soldiers by giving Him a kiss (Matthew 26:47-49). Jesus was arrested, and all His disciples fled (Matthew 26:56).
  </p>

  <h2>False Trials and Mockery</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus was taken to the high priest Caiaphas, where He was falsely accused by many witnesses (Matthew 26:59-60). He was mocked, beaten, and spat upon (Matthew 26:67-68). He was then sent to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, and later to Herod, before returning to Pilate for sentencing (Luke 23:6-11).
  </p>

  <h2>The Scourging</h2>
  <p>
    Though Pilate found no guilt in Him, he had Jesus scourged to satisfy the crowd (John 19:1). Jesus was whipped brutally with a Roman flagrum, a whip designed to tear flesh. Soldiers then placed a crown of thorns on His head, dressed Him in a purple robe, and mocked Him as “King of the Jews” (John 19:2-3).
  </p>

  <h2>Carrying the Cross</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus was forced to carry His own cross to the place of crucifixion, known as Golgotha (John 19:17). Weakened by the scourging, He collapsed along the way. Simon of Cyrene was compelled to carry the cross for Him (Luke 23:26).
  </p>

  <h2>The Crucifixion</h2>
  <p>
    At Golgotha, Jesus was nailed to the cross—hands and feet pierced (Luke 23:33). The soldiers cast lots for His clothing (John 19:23-24). He was crucified between two criminals, and above Him a sign read: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews” (Matthew 27:37).
  </p>
  <p>
    As He hung in agony, the crowd mocked Him. “He saved others, but He can’t save Himself!” they said (Matthew 27:42). Jesus prayed, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34).
  </p>

  <h2>Final Moments</h2>
  <p>
    From noon to 3 PM, darkness covered the land (Matthew 27:45). In His final moments, Jesus cried out, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (Matthew 27:46), and then, “It is finished” (John 19:30). He gave up His spirit and died.
  </p>
  <p>
    At that moment, the temple curtain tore from top to bottom, the earth shook, and many tombs broke open (Matthew 27:51-52). A Roman centurion declared, “Surely He was the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54).
  </p>

  <h2>The Burial</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus’ body was taken down and laid in a new tomb owned by Joseph of Arimathea (Matthew 27:57-60). A large stone was rolled in front of the entrance, and guards were posted to secure it (Matthew 27:66).
