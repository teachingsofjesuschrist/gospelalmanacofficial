   <h1 style="color: blue;">The Last Supper</h1>
<h2>Luke 22:1–20</h2>

  <p>The Feast of Unleavened Bread, also called Passover, was approaching. The chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to kill Jesus, fearing the people. At this moment, Satan entered Judas Iscariot. He conspired with them to betray Jesus for money (v.1–6).</p>

  <p>Jesus sent Peter and John to prepare the Passover meal. He told them to follow a man carrying a jar of water. That man would lead them to an upper room already furnished. There, they made everything ready (v.7–13).</p>

  <p>When the hour came, Jesus reclined at the table with His twelve apostles. He said, “With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” (v.15–16)</p>

  <p>He took a cup, gave thanks, and said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves. For I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” (v.17–18)</p>

  <p>Then He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them saying, “This is My body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of Me.” Likewise, after supper, He took the cup again and said, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.” (v.19–20)</p>
