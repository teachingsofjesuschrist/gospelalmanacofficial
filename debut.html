  <h1>The Debut of Jesus Christ</h1>

  <h2>Announcement of His Birth</h2>
  <p>
    The story of Jesus' debut begins even before His birth. The angel Gabriel appeared to a young virgin named Mary in Nazareth and told her that she would conceive a child by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:26-35). The angel called the child “Jesus,” meaning “The Lord saves,” and said He would be called the Son of the Most High.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mary accepted the message humbly, saying, “I am the Lord’s servant. May your word to me be fulfilled” (Luke 1:38). She later visited her relative Elizabeth, who was pregnant with John the Baptist, and Mary praised God in what is now called the “Magnificat” (Luke 1:46-55).
  </p>

  <h2>The Birth in Bethlehem</h2>
  <p>
    Due to a Roman census, Mary and Joseph traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem (Luke 2:1-4). While there, Mary gave birth to Jesus and laid Him in a manger because there was no room at the inn (Luke 2:6-7). 
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, an angel appeared to shepherds in the fields, announcing the birth of the Savior (Luke 2:8-11). The shepherds hurried to Bethlehem and found Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus, just as the angel said (Luke 2:16-20).
  </p>

  <h2>Visit of the Magi</h2>
  <p>
    Sometime after Jesus’ birth, wise men (or Magi) from the East arrived in Jerusalem, following a star that led them to Jesus (Matthew 2:1-2). King Herod secretly met with them, pretending he wanted to worship the child but intending to kill Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    The star led the Magi to the house where Jesus was, and they worshiped Him, offering gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh (Matthew 2:11). Warned in a dream, they returned home by a different route (Matthew 2:12).
  </p>

  <h2>Escape to Egypt and Return to Nazareth</h2>
  <p>
    An angel warned Joseph to flee to Egypt because Herod planned to kill Jesus (Matthew 2:13). The family escaped just in time. Herod then ordered the killing of all boys under two years old in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:16-18).
  </p>
  <p>
    After Herod's death, an angel told Joseph it was safe to return. The family settled in Nazareth in Galilee, where Jesus would grow up (Matthew 2:19-23).
  </p>

  <h2>The Boy Jesus at the Temple</h2>
  <p>
    At the age of 12, Jesus and His family visited Jerusalem for the Passover. When His parents began the journey home, Jesus stayed behind, unknowingly to them. After searching for three days, they found Him in the temple, discussing with teachers and amazing everyone with His understanding (Luke 2:41-47).
  </p>
  <p>
    When Mary questioned Him, Jesus responded, “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?” (Luke 2:49). He returned with His parents and continued to grow in wisdom and favor with God and people (Luke 2:51-52).
  </p>

  <h2>The Baptism of Jesus</h2>
  <p>
    Around the age of 30, Jesus came to the Jordan River to be baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:13). Though John hesitated, Jesus insisted, saying it was proper to fulfill all righteousness.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Jesus was baptized, the heavens opened, the Holy Spirit descended on Him like a dove, and a voice from heaven declared, “This is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:16-17).
  </p>

  <h2>The Temptation in the Wilderness</h2>
  <p>
    After His baptism, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, where He fasted for 40 days and nights (Matthew 4:1-2). There, Satan tempted Him three times: to turn stones into bread, to throw Himself down from the temple, and to worship Satan in exchange for power.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus resisted every temptation using Scripture (Matthew 4:3-10), and afterward, angels came to care for Him (Matthew 4:11).
  </p>

  <h2>The Beginning of Public Ministry</h2>
  <p>
    After John the Baptist was arrested, Jesus began His public ministry by preaching, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near” (Matthew 4:17). He traveled through Galilee, teaching in synagogues, healing the sick, and casting out demons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus called His first disciples—Peter and Andrew, then James and John—saying, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:18-22). They immediately left everything to follow Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crowds from all over began to follow Jesus as His fame spread. This marked the true beginning of the Messiah’s mission to change the world, not with power, but with truth, love, and sacrifice (Matthew 4:23-25).
