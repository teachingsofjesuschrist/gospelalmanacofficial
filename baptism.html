   <h1 style="color: blue;">The Baptism of Jesus</h1>
  <h2>Matthew 3:1–17</h2>

  <p>In the wilderness of Judea, a man named John the Baptist began preaching. He wore camel’s hair and a leather belt, and his food was locusts and wild honey. He cried out, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!” (v.2). His voice echoed like the prophecy from Isaiah: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.”</p>

  <p>People from Jerusalem and all around the Jordan came to him. They confessed their sins and were baptized in the Jordan River. But when John saw the Pharisees and Sadducees approaching, he rebuked them: “O generation of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance!” (v.7–8).</p>

  <p>He warned them not to rely on their ancestry, saying, “God can raise up children to Abraham from these stones.” He foretold the coming of someone greater, saying, “I baptize with water, but He who comes after me is mightier than I… He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” (v.11)</p>

  <p>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. John hesitated, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and You come to me?” But Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” So John consented (v.13–15).</p>
