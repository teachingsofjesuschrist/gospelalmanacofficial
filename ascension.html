 <h2>Acts 1:1–11</h2>

  <p>In his former book, Luke addressed Theophilus, recounting all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day He was taken up to heaven. Before ascending, Jesus gave instructions to the apostles through the Holy Spirit (v.1–2).</p>

  <p>After His resurrection, Jesus showed Himself alive with many proofs, appearing to them over forty days and speaking of the Kingdom of God. While staying with them, He commanded, “Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father. John baptized with water, but in a few days, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.” (v.3–5)</p>

  <p>They asked, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons the Father has fixed by His authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (v.6–8)</p>

  <p>After He said this, He was taken up before their eyes, and a cloud hid Him from their sight. As they gazed into the sky, two men in white appeared and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen Him go.” (v.9–11)</p>
