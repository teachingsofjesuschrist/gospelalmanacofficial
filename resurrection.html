     <h1>The Resurrection of Jesus Christ</h1>

  <h2>The Morning of the Third Day</h2>
  <p>
    After Jesus’ death and burial, His body lay in the tomb guarded by Roman soldiers (Matthew 27:65-66). On the third day—Sunday morning—something miraculous occurred.
  </p>
  <p>
    As dawn broke, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to visit the tomb (Matthew 28:1). Suddenly, there was a violent earthquake, and an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled back the stone, and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow (Matthew 28:2-3).
  </p>

  <h2>The Tomb Is Empty</h2>
  <p>
    The guards were so afraid that they shook and became like dead men (Matthew 28:4). The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; He has risen, just as He said” (Matthew 28:5-6).
  </p>
  <p>
    The angel invited them to see the place where Jesus had lain and told them to go quickly and tell His disciples (Matthew 28:7).
  </p>

  <h2>Jesus Appears to the Women</h2>
  <p>
    As the women ran to share the news, Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They clasped His feet and worshiped Him. Jesus said, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see Me” (Matthew 28:9-10).
  </p>

  <h2>The Guards’ Report and the Cover-Up</h2>
  <p>
    The guards reported everything to the chief priests. The religious leaders bribed the soldiers to lie and say that Jesus’ disciples stole the body while they slept (Matthew 28:11-15). This false story was spread among the Jews for many years.
  </p>

  <h2>Appearances to the Disciples</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus appeared multiple times to His disciples. In the Gospel of John, He appeared to Mary Magdalene at the tomb (John 20:14-17), then to the disciples behind locked doors (John 20:19-20).
  </p>
  <p>
    One week later, He appeared again, this time showing His hands and side to Thomas, who had doubted (John 20:26-29). Jesus said to him, “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”
  </p>

  <h2>The Road to Emmaus</h2>
  <p>
    In Luke 24:13-35, two followers of Jesus were walking to Emmaus when Jesus joined them, though they didn’t recognize Him. He explained how the Scriptures foretold His death and resurrection. Their eyes were opened when He broke bread with them, and they rushed back to Jerusalem to tell the others.
  </p>

  <h2>The Great Commission</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus met His disciples on a mountain in Galilee. He said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations… And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matthew 28:18-20).
  </p>

  <h2>The Ascension</h2>
  <p>
    Forty days after His resurrection, Jesus led His disciples to the Mount of Olives. He promised them the Holy Spirit and then ascended into heaven before their eyes (Acts 1:9-11).
  </p>
  <p>
    Two angels appeared and said, “This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen Him go.”
